            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>mashed potatoes are perfectly rich and creamy, full of great flavor, easy to make, and always a crowd fave. Easily one of my favorite comfort food.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potatoes- 1 kg</li>
                    <li>Butter- 250 grams</li>
                    <li>Garlic- 4 cloves</li>
                    <li>Milk- 300 ml</li>
                    <li>Sea Salt</li>
                    <li>Sour Cream- 1/2 cup</li>
                    <li>Grated Parmesan Cheese- 1/2 cup</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>Cut the potatoes (peeled or unpeeled) in even sized chunks around 1 - 1 and 1/2 inch thick. Then transfer them into a stockpot full of cold of water until they are ready to go.</ol>
                <ol>Once all of your potatoes are cut, be sure that there is enough cold water in the pan so that the water line sits about 1 inch above the potatoes. Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon salt to the water. Then turn on high heat until the water comes to a boil. And boil the potatoes for about 10-12 minutes until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes in with almost no resistance. Carefully drain out all of the water.</ol>
                <ol>Meanwhile, as the potatoes are boiling, heat your butter, milk and an additional 2 teaspoons of sea salt together either in a small saucepan or in the microwave until the butter is just melted. (You want to avoid boiling the milk.)  Set aside until ready to use.</ol>
                <ol>Return the potatoes to the hot stockpot, and then place the stockpot back on the hot burner, turning the heat down to low. Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining steam within the potatoes. Then remove the stockpot entirely from the heat.</ol>
                <ol>Mash the potatos to your desired consistency using any masher of choice.</ol>
                <ol>Then pour half of the melted butter mixture over the potatoes, and fold it in with a wooden spoon or spatula until potatoes have soaked up the liquid. Repeat with the remaining butter. And then again with the sour cream and grated parmesan. Fold each addition in until just combined to avoid overmixing, or else you will end up with gummy potatoes.</ol>
                <ol>One final time, adding in extra salt (plus black pepper, if you would like) to taste.</ol>
                <ol>Enjoy! You can serve it with any toppings of choice, or as an accompaniment to barbecue or braised beef.</ol>
