            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 large eggs</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp neutral flavored oil</li>
                    <li>2 tsp dashi</li>
                    <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tsp mirin</li>
                    <li>2 pinch salt</li>

                </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Gently whisk the eggs in a bowl. It's best to "cut" the eggs with chopsticks in a zig-zag motion; do not overmix.</li>
                    <li>In another bowl, combine the seasonings and mix well.</li>
                    <li>Pour the seasonings mixture into the eggs and whisk gently. Then pour the mixture into a measuring cup with a spout and handle so that it'll be easier to pour into the frying pan.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan over medium heat, dip a folded paper towel in the oil, and apply some of it to the pan. Put a drop of the egg mixture in the pan to see if the pan is hot. When you hear a sizzling sound, the pan is ready.</li>
                    <li>Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the pan, quickly tilting the pan so that the egg mixture coats the entire cooking surface.</li>
                    <li>Poke any air bubbles to release the air. After the bottom of the egg has set but is still soft on top, start rolling the egg into a log shape from one side to the other, starting from the far side of the pan and rolling toward the pan handle.</li>
                    <li>Move the rolled omelette to the far side of the pan where you started to roll, and apply more oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour in a thin layer of the egg mixture to just cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.</li>
                    <li>When the new layer of egg has set and is still soft on top, start rolling it from one side to the other.</li>
                    <li>Move the rolled omelette to the side where you started to roll and apply more oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette.</li>
                    <li>Pour in a thin layer of the egg mixture to just cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.</li>
                    <li>When the new layer of egg has set and is still soft on top, start rolling it from one side to the other.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process until all the eggs has been used.</li>
                </ol>
