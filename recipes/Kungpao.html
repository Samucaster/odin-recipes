            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Deseed, cut and rinse the chilis. Slice the garlic and the ginger. Cut the leek. Prepare the slurry and the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Add some hot, boiled water to the peanuts, let them sit for ten minutes, and peel them.</li>
                    <li>Tenderize the chicken with the dull side of a knife, then cut into 1/2 inch pieces.</li>
                    <li>Mix in the cornstarch well together with the egg white. Add in the salt and sugar to the chicken and mix. Add in the cornstarch-egg white mixture to the chicken and mix. Add the liaojiu wine and the dark soy sauce to the chicken and mix. Let that marinate for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Deep fry the peanuts at ~150C for five minutes, til nice and golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Keeping your flame on maximum, toss in the chicken at 185C. Break it apart with chopsticks, and let fry untouched for 10 seconds. Then stir it a bit with your spatula for another 20 seconds, and strain the chicken and drain out the oil. </li>
                    <li>Heat on low, toss in the chilis and the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook for about a minute til the color of the chilis deepen.</li>
                    <li>Add in the garlic and the ginger, up the heat to medium high. If you were using one of those optional ingredients for color, this is when you'd add it. Stir-fry for about a minute till everything starts to smell real nice.</li>
                    <li>Add in the sauce around the sides of the wok. Stir and let it quickly reduce for ~30 seconds, it should start to look almost like a thin syrup.</li>
                    <li>Add in the leeks. Give em a real brief mix.</li>
                    <li>Add in the chicken. Stir fry for 30 seconds, tossing it if ya can for a more even coating.</li>
                    <li>Add in the peanuts. Give it all a brief mix.</li>
                    <li>Add in the cornstarch slurry. Fry for ~10 seconds to let thicken.</li>
                    <li>Done.</li>
                </ol>
